I'm a staff software engineer at [Google Research](https://research.google). My current research revolves around video understanding, in particular learning long video representations. Before that, I dabbled in landmark recognition, image localization, large-scale image retrieval and clustering. Prior to joining Google, I did my PhD at the [RWTH Vision Lab](https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/) with [Bastian Leibe](https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/person/1/).
