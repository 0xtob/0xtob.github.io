Hi there! I'm a Computer Vision researcher at [Google Research](https://research.google) working on video understanding, with a focus on learning long video representations. Before that, I dabbled in landmark recognition, image localization, large-scale image retrieval and clustering. Prior to joining Google, I did my PhD at the [RWTH Aachen Vision Lab](https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/) with [Bastian Leibe](https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/person/1/). I earned my Dipoma (MS) in Computer Science from [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de).

In a past life, I worked on some Nintendo DS homebrew projects that can be found on my [Github page](https://github.com/0xtob).
